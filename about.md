# About the bot
Thanks for checking out **LabsUtilty**! Below is information and common questions about the bot!
<br/>
<br/>
### What Is LabsUtility?
LabsUtility is a muli-use / purpose bot made for Discord! The bot contains commands for developers, server staff, and regular community members! The bot can be added in two ways:
- `Added as a bot to a server`
- `Added as a authorized app to a user` <br/>
↳ (which allows for the user of many commands anywhere on Discord regardless if the server has the bot!)
